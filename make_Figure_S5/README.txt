Instructions:

- Run simulation_code/cost_of_estimation_code_for_Swarm_panels_ab.R and simulation_code/cost_of_estimation_code_for_Swarm_panels_cd.R for all the
combinations listed in simulation_code/Swarm_cost_of_estimation_panels_ab and simulation_code/Swarm_cost_of_estimation_panels_cd (first change
all the directories and create a directory caled simResults and swarmOUT if using swarm)
- Run simulation_code/cost_of_estimation_combine_results_code_for_Swarm_panels_ab.R and 
simulation_code/cost_of_estimation_combine_results_code_for_Swarm_panels_cd.R for all the
combinations listed in simulation_code/Swarm_cost_of_estimation_combine_results_panels_ab and 
simulation_code/Swarm_cost_of_estimation_combine_results_panels_cd (first change all the directories and create a directory called simResultsComb)
- All the summary results will be in simResultsComb (not uploaded here due to storage limitations)
- Run make_Figure_S5.Rnw to use the summary results from simResultsComb to generate Figure S5

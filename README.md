Code, figures, and tables for paper "Multivariate meta-analysis with an increasing number of parameters" by Simina M. Boca, Ruth M. Pfeiffer, Joshua N. Sampson

Each directory corresponds to 1 or 2 figures or tables in the paper and provides the complete code to generate them.
Each directory also has a README.txt file with specific instructions. The directories corresponding to figures also have a subdirectory titled "figures" which contain the actual figures in the manuscript.

Figure 1, Table 3, Figure S2, and Figure S3 can be generated directly from the code provided and are not simulation-based. They are obtained by simply running the *.Rnw files in the respective directories.

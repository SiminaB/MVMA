Instructions:

- Run simulation_code/cost_of_estimation_code_for_Swarm.R for all the combinations listed in simulation_code/Swarm_cost_of_estimation (first change
all the directories and create a directory caled simResults and swarmOUT if using swarm)
- Run simulation_code/cost_of_estimation_combine_results_code_for_Swarm.R for all the combinations listed in 
simulation_code/Swarm_cost_of_estimation_combine_results (first change all the directories and create a directory called simResultsComb)
- All the summary results will be in simResultsComb (not uploaded here due to storage limitations)
- Run make_Figure_S6_S7.Rnw to use the summary results from simResultsComb to generate Figures S6 and S7
